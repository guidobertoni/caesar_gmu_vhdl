D. Supported types and order of segment types

    a. input to encryption          npub, ad, data
    b. output from encryption       data, tag
    c. input to decryption          npub, ad, data, tag    
    d. output from decryption       data

E. Deviations from the CAESAR Hardware API v1.0 specification
    
    None
E.1

	The tag size is fixed to 8 bytes.
	
	The nonce size is fixed to 12 bytes.
	
	Ketje supports sessions, in few words a session consists in absorbing key and nonce only at the beginning of the session establishment and after processing messages in an ordered sequence without requiring keys or additional nonceâ€™s. We have tested wiht a couple of messages, the session is full-duplex in the sense that messages coudl be encrypted and decrypted with any order.
	

F. Disagreement with the Appendix to the CAESAR Hardware API v1.0
